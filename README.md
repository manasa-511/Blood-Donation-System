# Blood-Donation-System
This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The system can collect and store blood donor information in a MySQL database, accessed via PHPMyAdmin. On the transfusion page, users can search for specific blood types, view a table of available donors, and contact them directly based on their needs.
